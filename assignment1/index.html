  <p> My name is Lauren Lucernoni and this is my last semester in the MS degree for Learning Design and Technology. I am currently a Pre-K ASD teacher. My focus tends to be on how to engage students with learning disabilities in online platforms. I really love to work on projects that have a lot of student engagement enhancements. My previous work experience was in sales, marketing, advertising, and design. I feel that ID is everything that I am good at and I love doing. Looking forward to finishing off this year with a great addition to my portfolio! </p>
