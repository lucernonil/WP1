<h1>International Baccalaureate (IB) Program</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: What is the Diploma Programme?
    A: The International Baccalaureate (IB) has four programs: the Primary Years Programme
    (PYP), the Middle Years Programme (MYP), the Career-related Programme (CP), and the
    Diploma Programme (DP). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: What are the advantages of enrolling in the IB Program?
    A: Colleges look favorably upon applicants who embraced the challenge of the IB. Graduates
    consistently report that their involvement in the IB gave them the tools necessary to succeed
    in college. Former IB students usually make remarks related to their sense of preparedness,
    self-confidence, research skills, and their ability to manage their time. Additionally, these
    students have indicated a sense of the larger world around them and their responsibility to
    it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: How does a student earn the IB Diploma?
    A: To earn the IB Diploma, a student must pass examinations in six (6) subject areas, write a
    4,000-word extended essay (EE) describing an independent research question, fulfill the 150-
    hour Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) requirement, and pass the IB Theory of
    Knowledge (TOK) class.

    <br>
    Q: What does a student accomplish by earning the IB Diploma?
    A: IB Diploma recipients earn a credential that proves beyond reproach that they rank among
    the very best students in the world. IB students are eligible for course credit awarded at the
    discretion of individual colleges and universities. This ultimately translates into tuition
    dollars.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: What is meant by Higher Level (HL) and Standard Level (SL)?
    A: To earn the IB Diploma, a student will take examinations in six (6) different subject areas
    by the end of the senior year. Three (3) of these exams will be in courses that are Higher
    Level (HL) and three (3) in courses that are Standard Level (SL). There is no difference in the
    level of rigor of these courses! The distinction is in the quantity of the content material a
    candidate must master before examination.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: Why does Higher Level and Standard Level matter for scheduling?
    A: The IB dictates the hours of instructional time. Courses designed as preparation for IB
    examinations are two-year courses. The IB dictates that students in SL classes receive a
    minimum of 150 hours of instruction; for HL classes a minimum of 240 hours is required. In
    the second semester of the sophomore year, potential IB candidates must select their
    courses for the remaining two (2) years of high school.
