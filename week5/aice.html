<h1>Cambridge AICE Program</h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Q: What is AICE?
    A: The Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) is an international diploma that students can
    earn via an advanced academic curriculum and assessment program written and administered by a non-profit
    department (CIE) of the University of Cambridge in England. AICE program courses and examinations may
    be offered during grades 9-12 in schools worldwide registered as CIE Centres.
<br>
<br>
    Q: How long has AICE been in existence?
    A: While Cambridge University was founded in 1209, the AICE program has been in existence since the
    1950â€™s. It was introduced in the U.S. in 1994. The AICE diploma is offered at over 9,000 schools world wide.
<br>
<br>
    Q: What are the benefits of AICE?
    A: AICE not only prepares students to enter college with up to 30 hours of credit, it also provides them with
    the skills required to be successful once there. In addition, students who earn the AICE Diploma will qualify for
    the Florida Academic Bright Futures Scholarship. Students who pass individual papers (not earning the full
    diploma) will earn college credit for those papers passed.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: What do I have to do to earn an AICE Diploma?
    A: Students must pass seven credits worth of examinations. At least one examination must come from each
    of the four subject groups: Mathematics and Sciences, Languages, Arts and Humanities, and Interdisciplinary
    Skills Based. Advanced Subsidiary (AS) Level exams count for one credit and Advanced (A) Level exams
    count for two credits.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: Do all of the schools in Florida accept AICE exams?
    A: Yes. All of the colleges and universities in Florida honor AICE Exams and give credit for passing scores.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: How many college credits can be earned through AICE?
    A: Colleges and universities can award between 30 and 45 credit hours.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: Does AICE help towards Florida Bright Futures?
    A: Earn an AICE Diploma, do 100 hours of community service, and fill out the Florida Financial Aid Application
    and you will automatically earn the Academic Scholars Award. You will not have to get the benchmark score
    on the ACT or SAT.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: Is AICE only for Juniors and Seniors?
    A: No. As a freshman and a sophomore you take Pre-AICE classes. These classes prepare you for the
    rigorous AICE classes you will take as a junior and a senior. The Pre-AICE classes help you decide which
    AICE classes you will take. In addition, students enrolled as diploma seeking students will not have to take
    HOPE or the Fine Arts requirement.
    <br>
    <br>
    Q: How does AICE compare with IB?
    A: While both AICE and IB are rigorous programs, AICE allows the student the flexibility to specialize in
    subjects where they will have the most success as well as allowing them to take the elective classes they
    wish.
